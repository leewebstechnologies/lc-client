    desc: "The construction industry is undergoing a transformation as new technologies, environmental concerns, and safety regulations reshape how we build. Future building protocols must focus on sustainability, resilience, and efficiency to meet the demands of a rapidly changing world. Modern construction integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM), AI-driven project management, and robotic automation to enhance precision and reduce waste. Drones are increasingly used for site inspections, while 3D printing enables the rapid production of complex structures with minimal material usage. With climate change causing extreme weather events, buildings of the future must withstand natural disasters. Hurricane-proof materials, seismic-resistant structures, and flood-proof foundations will become standard in high-risk zones. Additionally, self-healing concrete and advanced coatings will increase the durability of infrastructure.",
